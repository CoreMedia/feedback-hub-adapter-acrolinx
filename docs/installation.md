Continue with [Activate the plugin](#activate-the-plugin).

## Download Release

Go to [Release](https://github.com/CoreMedia/feedback-hub-adapter-acrolinx/releases) and download the version that matches your CMCC release version.
The ZIP file provides the Maven workspace of the plugin.

## Activate the Plugin

The acrolinx feedbackhub adapter is a plugin for studio-server and studio-client.
The deployment of plugins is described [here](https://documentation.coremedia.com/cmcc-10/artifacts/2101/webhelp/coremedia-en/content/ApplicationPlugins.html).

In short, for a quick development roundtrip: 
1. Build your Blueprint.
2. Build the `feedback-hub-adapter-acrolinx` plugin with `mvn clean install`.
   Checkpoint: There should be zip files in the target directories of the `studio-client` and `studio-server` modules now.
3. Create a directory for studio-server plugins, e.g. `/tmp/studio-server-plugins`, 
and copy `feedback-hub-adapter-acrolinx/studio-server/target/studio-server.feedback-hub-adapter-acrolinx-<version>.zip`
into that directory.
4. Start the studio server as usual, e.g. `mvn spring-boot:run`, with an additional property `-Dplugins.directory=/tmp/studio-server-plugins`
5. Start the studio client as usual, e.g. `pnpm run start`. Now also execute `pnpm run start` in the plugin directory. 

Now the plugin is running.  You won't yet notice it though, until you configure a connection 
and restart the studio server.  

## Intellij IDEA Hints

For the IDEA import:
- Disable "Settings > Compiler > Clear output directory on rebuild"
- Ensure TypeScript compiler is set properly
